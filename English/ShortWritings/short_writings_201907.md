**Some people believe that** international sport creates goodwill between the nations and that if countries play games together they will learn to live together. **Others say that the opposite is true**: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to misunderstanding and hatred.

**There is probably some truth in both arguments**, but there is very likely to be a situation that current education, or specifically/to be specific, exams would **yield to/give place to** the ones judged by *not only* scores *but also* creative mind **with which an integrated man must equip**.

- invite somebody to do something 使某人做某事 lead somebody do something
- It/sth leads the question/discussion/issue to two extremes: one respect ... , another ... 可以用于阐述两方面的观点

The “#Metoo” movement leads the discussion of how to achieve gender equality to extremes: The radical side holds that males and females are expected to shared same rights in every respect.

Consequently, to reach gender equity is for one to enjoy its entitlements corresponding to features of its gender.
