# My view on gender equality

## [Background]

Gender equality is not hard to define, it means that females, generally the side in a disadvantaged position, and males who are better placed[get the upper hand], in theory, are supposed/expected to share a parity in education, finance, status and so on. Unfortunately, those who are have experienced or undergoing so-called “gender discrimination(or gender inequity)” constitute a remarkable proportion of all women.

## [The sources of gender inequality]

Thus a question mark hangs over it-how does gender inequality generate? Some people cite “patriarchy” in which men get an edge over women for thousands of years as a major reason. The lack of appropriate sex education, to certain extent, plays a part. The physical distinction between genders also serves as a secondary explanation, for example, boys tend to own a stronger body than do girls.

## [Personal view on it] ##

In my personal/private view, gender parity is the measure as well as the symbol of a modern and advanced society because of the inevitable trend that women are increasingly involving in the most far-reaching sectors/fields and playing a progressively essential role. Another point/opinion is that gender equity is a kind of relative fairness comparing with the dogmatic one. To/Towards that end(approaching gender parity), the radical transformation of traditional/conventional mind which hold that women are born to be inferior than men is the foremost must. Then action to improve females’ presence in workplace and remove the “glass ceiling” clouding over them are expected to be the province of it.

## [Conclusion]

There is multiple years ahead for current community to catch up gender parity, as a result, inequality of the sort will persist. To create/form a environment with equal opportunities for both genders, something within one’s ability can be done.
