# The meaning of mental health #

That a large number of/numerous people today are torn by psychological illness/issues imposed by challenges of all stripes in daily life, from grindingly long office/work hours to jaw-droppingly/eye-poppingly high housing price, leads people to think over the essential/cricial role played by mental health in alleviating/mitigating the non-material burden they are shouldering.

So far, three threats can be stirred up/evoked by mental illness(abnormal/negative mental condition). One is that it places a bad/harmful/undesirable impact on the way we behave, such as suicide. Second involves the erosion of our regular social communication/relationship, such as social-phobia which cuts the connection between one from the whole world. The greater threats is over the horrors/malaise like Stockholm Syndrome, which is capable of spreading among the masses.

Yet positive mental condition can weigh against the threats above posed by the negative one. For a start, it is not a hindrance/hurdle for a position person to cooperate with another one. Plus, people with excellent quality of mentality are likely/inclined/often more than not to endure more setback so that they occupy more possibility to achieve success. To dig into the nature of it further, a good psychological situation, as a part of personality, can inspire others in a invisible/intangible way.

Mental health is the elephant in the room that matters a lot. The positive side of it is the dynamics of personal/social development, while its negative side is the hurdle/obstacle. To accomplish material or ideological achievement, fostering/cultivating  a mental condition in perspective is a must.
